# AnimalGuessing
The animal guessing game is a Python program that allows users to guess the name of an animal based on a series of clues. The program works by displaying a series of clues to the user, each of which narrows down the possible animals that the user might be thinking of. 

The program includes a database of various animals and their characteristics, which is used to generate the clues and narrow down the possibilities. The program also includes a feature that allows users to add new animals and characteristics to the database, making it possible to play the game with an ever-expanding list of animals.
